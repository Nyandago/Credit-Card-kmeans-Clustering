In this Jupyter Notebook I will attempt to use K-Means Clustering algorithm from Scikit-Learn package in Python on the Credit Card Dataset I have found on Kaggle. 

This dataset contains information about active 9000 credit card holders during the 6 month period. It is moderately large and requires some cleaning. After cleaning the data I will try to cluster customers with accounts that have similar Balance to Credit Limit ratio. These clusters will then inform the email marketing campaign of the bank by tailoring direct communication with customers to the state of their accounts.

OBJECTIVE: To create clusters of customers based on the balance to credit limit ratio in their accounts for the purposes of an email marketing campaign.
